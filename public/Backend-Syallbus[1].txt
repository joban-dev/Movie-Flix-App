9.What is Joi?
Joi is a powerful schema description language and data validator for JavaScript. It ensures that the data you receive (usually from user input like forms or API requests) is valid before processing or saving it into the MongoDB database.

 Why use Joi with MongoDB?
MongoDB is schema-less, which means it won’t stop you from inserting invalid or incomplete data. To avoid issues and maintain data consistency, we validate incoming data before inserting it into MongoDB. Joi helps with that.
